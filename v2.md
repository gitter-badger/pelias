I'd like to bring our internal @mapzen discussions about the API design out in to the public, so anyone who is interested can contribute ideas and add their input.

#### current API

We currently have the following [API endpoints](https://github.com/pelias/pelias):

- `/suggest`
- `/search`
- `/reverse`

Having a bit of time to retrospect, the current API has a few flaws which need to be addressed:

#### issues

- There is no way to address and retrieve a single resource by global id
- There is no way to address and retrieve multiple resources by global ids
- There is no distinction between the `schema` of returned documents
- There is no easy way to filter the results or to customise the query on the client
- There are some inconsistencies in naming of parameters
- It is not very `RESTful`
- There is a huge amount of power which can be exposed to the client which is currently not

#### use-cases

Internally we have had some discussions about how to make an API which is easily consumable from mobile devices. This will always be a prime concern of Pelias as mobile apps are clearly here to stay and a major consumer of geocoding APIs due to their mobile nature and device capabilities.

However it's also important to consider some other common use-cases for the API, eg:

- Postcode (zip code) lookups in forms

![zip_lookup](./img/postcode_lookup.png)

- More general place lookups in forms

![location_lookup](./img/location_lookup.png)

- etc...

A simple search will yield more results such as: [Connecting the Dots: Why Geocoding is Critical for Businesses](https://www.melissadata.com/featurearticles/geocoding-is-critical-for-businesses.htm)
